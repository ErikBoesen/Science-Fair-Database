            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p class="abstract">Some people want the fastest internet connection available when they are choosing a Linux distribution to use. However, there are no tests available of this criterion to help users make a decision.
A hypothesis was made that if the five most widely used Linux distributions (Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Debian, Mageia, and Fedora, along with Windows as a control) were tested, they would yield varying internet connection speeds, because each uses different drivers and software to connect to the internet.
In this experiment, the operating systems were  downloaded and flashed, and their internet connection statistics (obtained through a test on speedof.me) must be noted. The experiment is performed on a Dell Inspiron 560 desktop computer booted with each distro, on a wired connection, on the same network, in a short amount of time (to prevent external interference and experimental error). The Ping, Upload, and Download of the various distributions were measured. Three trials of each OS were performed.
Results were mixed. An algorithm (Download + Upload - Ping) was used to give each OS an overall score, and it was concluded that the best possible internet connection obtainable with mainstream operating systems can be obtained with Fedora. Windows should be avoided.
	The results sometimes supported the hypothesis, which was that the results would be varied. The results remained around the same (a score of 15-16) for all tests except for the outliers, Fedora and Windows (17.48 and 14.48). If you want internet speed, go with Fedora.</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p class="research"><strong>Introduction:</strong>Linux is an Operating System, like Windows or Mac OS X. The main difference is that it can be obtained in several different versions suited for specific needs. The five most popular versions (or “distros”) are Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Debian, Mageia, and Fedora. In this experiment, the internet connection speeds of various systems will be tested and compared. Experience with the Linux operating system is important in this experiment. No study of this sort has been done yet.<strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the distro ISOs. They can be found with a simple Google search for “(Distro name) download.”</li>
                <li>Burn the files to separate CD/DVDs.</li>
                <li>Set the computer to boot from disk via the BiOS.</li>
                <li>Insert the CD/DVD.</li>
                <li>Restart. The distro from the disk will boot on the computer.</li>
                <li>Open the default web browser (Mozilla Firefox).</li>
                <li>Navigate to speedof.me.</li>
                <li>Click “Start Test.”</li>
                <li>After a short wait, the tool will display your ping (“latency”), upload speed, and download speed.</li>
                <li>Write down these results.</li>
                <li>Repeat 4-10 thrice for each distribution.</li>
                <li>Find the average ping/DS/US for each. For ping, lower is better, and for US/DS higher is better.</li>
            </ol>

        <p class="results">As you can see, results were mixed and variable. Some anomalies are notable. Firstly, Fedora does some wierd stuff. It has the lowest Download speeds of any tested OS, and yet has the lowest Ping. Also, Windows 10 TP has the lowest Upload speed but also the second best ping. Perhaps trying to compare apples to oranges, I created a scoring system, which follows the algorithm Avg. Upload Speed + Average Download Speed - Ping. In this comparison, Windows 10 Technical Preview is the loser with 14.48, and Fedora is the winner with a score of 17.48. The others are all somewhere around 15 or 16.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In this experiment, I tested the internet speeds of the five most popular Linux distributions (as well as Windows 10 Technical Preview as a control) in order to help those trying to choose a Linux Distribution to use to make their decision. I hypothesized that if the five most widely used Linux distributions (Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Debian, Mageia, and Fedora) are compared, they will yield varying speeds, because each uses different software to connect to the internet. In this experiment, I downloaded and flashed each OS and compared their speeds with the website speedof.me.
	The investigation partially supported my hypothesis. I predicted that the speeds would be varied, and that they are. However, some operating systems, namely Fedora and Windows, behaved abnormally and contrary to prediction, both excelling in Ping but faltering in Download and Upload speeds respectively.
	I used a quick equation (UL+DL-Ping) to give the OSs an overall score. Windows lost at 14.48 while Fedora took the crown at 17.48. No other official studies have been done on this subject. However, these results will soon be published online and people may be able to make a better distribution choice.
	There are many potential sources of experimental error in this procedure. When experimenting with internet connection, it’s very difficult to keep everything constant. For example, additional devices connecting and disconnecting from the network can split the power of the router and cause the results to vary over time. Or, the testing computer may be using bandwidth on tasks other than the test, this is very difficult to detect or stop. Furthermore, large-scale disruptions, such as storms, could interrupt the Router’s signal from Verizon. This is unlikely, but it could happen. Of course, this experiment was only performed on one device, a Dell Inspiron 560, a device that may have an abnormality which may cause error.
	If this experiment was done again, many sources of error could be quenched. For example, a dedicated network connection directly connected to the service provider, free from disruption, could be used, in order to minimize variation caused by outside interference. If an extremely accurate result was necessary, many different computers could be tested to ensure the most standard, accurate result.</p>
